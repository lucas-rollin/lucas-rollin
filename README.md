# Hi there, I'm Lucas Rollin Ferreira üëã

I'm a Civil Engineer turned Data Enthusiast with a passion for solving complex problems through data analysis and web development. With a strong background in project planning and process optimization, I now focus on creating data-driven solutions using Python, SQL, and Power BI. My goal is to bridge the gap between engineering and technology, delivering insights and tools that make a real impact.

When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or diving into the world of gaming analytics.
