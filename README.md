# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me

I am a Civil Engineer graduated from UFSC (Federal University of Santa Catarina) with experience in project planning, data analysis, and construction. Specializing in process optimization and operational management, I utilize tools such as Python, SQL, Power BI, and MS Project to create strategic solutions.

Currently, I work at ARESC, where I am involved in inspection, regulation, and the development of dashboards. I also undertake freelance projects in the technology sector, focusing on customized solutions for data analysis and planning.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work at SCGÁS, where I contributed to project monitoring and market intelligence. Additionally, I worked at D'Campos Construtora, where I was responsible for project management, including planning and control of construction projects, as well as quality management through the development of construction manuals and FVS (Field Verification Sheets).
